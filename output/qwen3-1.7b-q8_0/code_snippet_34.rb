  puts "Ruby differences:\n" +
        "1. Dynamic typing and flexibility in syntax.\n" +
        "2. Uses `Object` as a base class for all objects.\n" +
        "3. Strongly typed, but type inference is automatic.\n" +
        "4. Uses `def` for methods and `class` for classes.\n" +
        "5. Supports metaprogramming and pattern matching."
