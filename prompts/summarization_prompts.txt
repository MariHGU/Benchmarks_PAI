There are times when the night sky glows with bands of color. The bands may begin as cloud shapes and then spread into a great arc across the entire sky. They may fall in folds like a curtain drawn across the heavens. The lights usually grow brighter, then suddenly dim. During this time the sky glows with pale yellow, pink, green, violet, blue, and red. These lights are called the Aurora Borealis. Some people call them the Northern Lights. Scientists have been watching them for hundreds of years. They are not quite sure what causes them. In ancient times people were afraid of the Lights. They imagined that they saw fiery dragons in the sky. Some even concluded that the heavens were on fire.
Throughout human history, time has been both a mystery and a measure. Ancient civilizations used the movement of the stars and the shadows of the sun to track its passing. The Babylonians divided hours, the Egyptians built sundials, and the Mayans crafted calendars that stretched across centuries. In medieval Europe, monks rang bells to mark prayers, giving structure to monastic life. But time has never been only about clocks—it shapes our memories and our sense of the future. Physicists describe time as a dimension woven into the fabric of space, while some philosophers argue it may be an illusion. Still, we chase it, sell it, waste it, and save it. It stretches in moments of boredom and disappears in times of joy. Though we can’t hold it, we constantly feel its pull. Every culture has tried to tame it, yet it remains as fluid and elusive as ever.
Beneath the surface of the world’s oceans lies an alien realm. In the absence of sunlight, creatures produce their own glow, and predators sense movement through vibrations in the water. Some fish have jaws that unhinge to swallow prey twice their size. Others remain still for hours, invisible against the black. The pressure is immense—crushing to human-built machines—yet life persists in bizarre and beautiful forms. Scientists send submersibles into the depths, discovering new species with each descent. But much remains unexplored. The deep sea is Earth’s final frontier—not in distance, but in mystery.
Memory is not a recording device. It is a reconstruction—fragmented, shaped by emotion, and vulnerable to suggestion. Two people can witness the same event and recall it differently days later, each convinced their version is true. Neuroscientists have discovered that every time we remember something, we subtly alter it. The brain rewires the trace, layering on new meaning, sometimes distorting the original. A childhood laugh may echo brighter than it ever was; a moment of shame may sharpen with time. In legal trials, eyewitness accounts—once held as gold—are now scrutinized for these imperfections. But memory is more than fact-checking. It builds identity. Without it, we would be rootless, stuck in an eternal present. Alzheimer’s doesn’t just erase names—it erases the sense of self. And yet, forgetting can also be a gift. Trauma may fade, wounds may dull, and forgiveness may blossom in the space that forgetting leaves behind. Memory, like time, both defines and deceives us.
